# BloodBond - Revolutionizing Blood Donation & Transfusion

Blood donation and transfusion systems are essential lifelines in modern healthcare, offering crucial support to people battling various medical conditions, undergoing surgery, and dealing with unexpected emergencies. However, even in the presence of these critical systems, there exists an imperative, an unmet need that calls for our attention and action – the oversight of those with specialized needs.  Many individuals facing chronic illnesses such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or cancer require regular blood transfusions. Unfortunately, these needs often slip through the cracks, unnoticed within most of the blood donatation and transfusion healthcare system.

BloodBond is a platform designed to facilitate the blood donation and transfusion process for individuals who require regular transfusions. It aims to address the lack of a system for these individuals and provide a centralized platform for donation and matching, using technologies like mySQL, SQL, React, and Javascript More specifically, the platform uses React for a user-friendly interface and Amazon-hosted mySQL for real-time data storage. The platform allows people to sign up to donate blood, get matched to receive blood, and connect with their donors. Donors can easily schedule donations, and medical staff can efficiently move blood from donors to medical facilities and from facilities to recipients.
